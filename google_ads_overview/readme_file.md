## Overall Performance Metrics

- Clicks: 35.4K (↑ 42.9%) → Big improvement in engagement.
- Impressions: 1.5M (↑ 85.6%) → Campaign reach expanded significantly.
- CTR (Click-Through Rate): 2.3% (↓ 23%) → Although clicks increased, the CTR dropped because impressions grew faster than clicks (reach went up, quality of targeting may have diluted).
- Conversions: 1.7K (↑ 28.1%) → Strong growth in actual outcomes.
- Conversion Rate: 4.7% (↓ 10.4%) → Conversion efficiency slightly weakened despite higher volumes.
- Cost / Conversion: $4.75 (↓ 13.2%) → More cost-effective conversions.
- Total Cost: $7.87K (↑ 11.2%) → Spending went up, but ROI is improving.
- ROAS: Trending around 2–3x → Healthy, though could be optimized further.
- Avg. CPC: $0.22 (↓ 22.2%) → Cheaper clicks.
- Avg. CPM: $5.15 (↓ 40.1%) → Lower cost to reach 1,000 people — media efficiency improved.

Insight: Reach expanded at lower cost per impression/click, driving more clicks and conversions overall, but engagement and conversion efficiency weakened (CTR ↓, Conv. rate ↓).

## Campaign-Level Insights

Top Performing Campaigns:
- Accessories: Lowest CPC ($0.08) and best Cost/Conv ($1.19).
- Active Wear: Strong CTR (2.93%), low CPC ($0.11), very efficient Cost/Conv ($1.86).
- Holiday Campaign: Highest CTR (5%), decent efficiency ($5.07).

Weak Spots:
- Biking: High Cost/Conv ($21.56) — needs reevaluation.
- Wearables: Expensive ($13.24 per conversion).
- T-Shirts: High CPC ($0.38) with moderate Cost/Conv ($6.31).

Insight: Accessories & Active Wear deliver the best ROI. Biking & Wearables campaigns are inefficient and need optimization or budget shift.

## Device-Level Breakdown

- Clicks, Cost, and Conversions split across devices show:
- Mobile is likely driving majority of clicks & conversions (67% noted in dashboard).
- Desktop and tablet contribute less.

# Insight: Optimize for mobile-first creatives & landing experiences.

Trend Analysis (Over Time)
- Clicks vs Cost/Conv: Clicks are climbing while cost/conversion is trending down → efficient growth.
- Conversion Rate & Cost: Conversion rate dipped, but cost/conversion improved, meaning scale is offsetting efficiency loss.
- ROAS & CPM: ROAS is stable with declining CPM → cost-efficient reach is sustaining returns.
- Cost & CPC: Both trending downward — paid media efficiency improving.

Insight: Growth strategy is working — expanding reach without proportional cost increase. But declining CTR and conversion rate suggest targeting/creative refinement is needed to sustain quality.

## Key Takeaways

- Volume is up, efficiency is good: More clicks & conversions at lower cost per unit.
- CTR & Conv. Rate need work: Engagement quality slipped — refine targeting, creatives, or keyword strategy.
- Winners vs Losers: Accessories & Active Wear are strong; Biking & Wearables are dragging performance.
- Mobile is dominant: Creative + site optimizations should prioritize mobile.
- Budget Allocation Opportunity: Shift budget towards high ROI campaigns while fixing or pausing underperformers.
